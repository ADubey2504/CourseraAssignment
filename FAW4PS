Problem Statement : XYZ Retail chain supplier aggregator wants to enter India by tapping flousirshing food delivery business.
Their business model is to source and supply ingredients (fresh exotic fruits/ vegetables,dairy etc) to restraunts directly.They want to 
set up hub and spoke network of suppliers in different region of city to cater the need of local restraunts.They want to do area wise
analysis to understand the which type of resturants dominates in the area so that they could stock the supplies accordingly.Each warehouse
would be able to serve the restraunts in 5 km radius.

They want to start pilot in New Delhi which is national capital of India. Also they would like to leverage the Metro connectivity in New
Delhi as local Metro Rail Corporation is auctioning shops in metro station premises. XYZ aims to use these shops as warehouse to supply
locally.

Now we need to design model to help XYZ retail chain supplier to do regional analysis to help them 
1. identify resturant profile of an area for each metro station as centre
2. identify which type restraunt they should cater in given area
